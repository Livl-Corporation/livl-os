# **📦 Prerequisites**
This project is developed in C language, so you need to have a C compiler installed on your machine. It would be better to run it on a Linux distribution, but it is possible to run it on Windows with the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux).

- `gcc` : `sudo apt install gcc`
- `make`: `sudo apt install make`

> To install the WSL, follow this [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).

# 🚀 Quick start
- In the root folder, go to the lab folder you want to use (ex: `cd 02-proc`)
- Run `make` to compile the project
- Run `./bin/<file>` to run the executable file generated by the `make` command
- Run `make clean` to clean the project


# **📁 Project structure**

- Each lab is in a folder named `<lab-number>-<exercise-name>`
- There are 6 labs in this project:
  - `01-syscall_fs`: System calls and file system
  - `02-proc`: Process management
  - `03-threads`: Threads management
  - `04-signals`: Process and signals
  - `08-docker`: Handle Docker
  - `09-docker`: Master Docker 
- Each lab folder contains the following structure (except for the `08-docker` and `09-docker` labs):

```
<lab-number>-<exercise-name>
├── bin/
│   └── file
├── include/
│   └── file.h
├── src/
│   └── file.c
└── Makefile
```

# **🔧 Pipeline**

- The pipeline is configured to run on each push and pull request on the `master` branch
- The pipeline is iterating over each directory in the root folder and run the `make` command if a `Makefile` is present
- The pipeline is also running the `make clean` command to clean the project after the `make` command

> You can find the pipeline configuration in the [`.github/workflows/c-make.yml`](.github/workflows/c-make.yml) file.
